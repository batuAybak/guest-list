   * It will be empty initialy, but .map execution at least won't fail
   *
   * GuestList renders first (fast),
   * fetch happens asynchronously afterward (slower).
   * The empty array ensures the first render doesnâ€™t crash.
   * â€¦so that GuestList can safely render before the data arrives.
   * Without this, calling .map() on undefined would throw an error.
